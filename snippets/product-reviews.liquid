            <p>This book is extremely well done. As an individual trained in CBT, I can say that it is very accurate to the school and methodology. It explains things very well, in a way that is understandable to people who don't know a lot about the field, in fact I have quoted from it in therapy sessions to help explain concepts to clients! In addition it can be useful for working things out on your own, I've found the worksheets very helpful in dealing with some of my own anxious thoughts. An excellent book, and would highly recommend.</p>

            <p>Keep this in every therapy office as a go to reference for every therapist & it gets heavy use especially from those newer to doing therapy. Many take it home often to read & look at when need ideas U don't need the workbook just this book. I would definitely use this to teach CBT. Great refresher & useful for clients. If it helps I am a Licensed Psychologist (Ph.D) many of our therapist s are LCSW & Licensed Professional Counselors so great no matter what your background.</p>

            <p>I use this book faithfully with my clientele' due to how much it is broken down to its most minute concept. The homework assignments in it are so easy to follow and breaks down the various illnesses so well such as depression, anger, anxiety and other ailments that client's really have that "AHA" moment when doing the homework. If they don't, they just don 't want to.</p>
            <p>I have purchased more of the "Dummies" series books and they have helped. Some clients have returned my books in favor of purchasing their own so they could highlight in them and share informatino with familymembers and other.</p>

            <p>I cannot say enough good things about this. Its a workbook with forms that you can fill out to work through problems and discover what your inclination is on thought processes. It helps you to change the way you look at things. Its also very insightful about the inclinations that many people have. You can discover the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. I'm very happy that I ordered this. Its a wonderful complement to the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy For Dummies book. The two of them should be ordered together in my opinion.</p>

I really enjoy how they took into consideration that everyone learns differently and use multiple techniques to explain with introductions in each chapter, definitions, pictures, scenarios, examples, followed by worksheets and quick summaries. Very helpful and never boring. I would definitely recommend!</p>

            <p>I'm all for Cognitive Therapy, I have done it myself and found huge success in my personal and professional life. I can handle things with so much ease, it's now second nature. I strongly recommend this book for every parent and every child who is struggling with whatever problem. Cognitive Therapy is for everybody. It's the answer to a medication free fight against anxiety and depression. I purchased it for a friend of mine but she wasn't ready for it, my mum also rejected it which was a shame because I know, really know that it would have turned their lives around 180 degrees. My daughter in law took it gladly and she is now reaping the benefits.</p>

            <p>Lear's book is a continuation of Freud's "metapsychology," offering new ways to conceptualize some of what happens in psychoanalysis. His starting point is one which would seem obvious but is in fact rare in psychoanalytic writings... he offers some brilliant insights, especially about subjectivity vs. "objectivity" and about transference. But Lear's book is an "easy read" because the writing is loose and casual... While his style is a refreshing change from the professional, impersonal prose of most analytic monographs, he also seems to address his peers as though they were laypersons.</p>
