          <p>And if you are a survivor of childhood trauma, maybe this book can help you understand why you can "bounce back," and "endure" things even when you begin to believe there's no way you can.</p>
          <p>Reading <em>What Happened To You?</em> by Dr. Bruce D. Perry and the phenomenal Oprah Winfrey opened up a few windows to my heart and tapped into some areas that needed care and tenderness. I survived a whole heap of mess that could have been so much worse than it was, and I am glad it wasn't.</p>
          <p>Learning who we are and why we act the way we do starts with assessing what happened to us. What caused us to grow up with hardened hearts, lack of trust, unwillingness to love, fear of the unfamiliar, etc.?</p>
          <p>This book dives into the many functions of the brain post-traumatic experiences and various methods geared toward healing and growth.</p>
          <p>I love how both Dr. Perry and Oprah tag-team each scenario and offer their views of them and a way to move past the incidents and become somewhat whole again by learning how to regulate ourselves and gravitate toward safe spaces and environments.</p>
          <p>If ever you feel as though you want to know more about why you continually hold on when you want to let go, reading this book is a great way to glean additional information about how you're wired and why.</p>
          <p>It is worth one's time and attention, and you will certainly learn more about living through childhood trauma and how to maintain a positive outlook and a sustainable adulthood.</p>

          <p>I finished this book in a weekend. The book was so easy to follow and it reads easily as it is basically a conversation. Since I comprehend a lot better when I follow an audio version of any book, I found having headphones on as I moved throughout the daily chores and tasks allowed me to gain insight to the long term effects of trauma that stems from early childhood, while completing those mundane yet necessary tasks.</p>
          <p>The most profound concept I obtained from this well organized journey through early childhood trauma or adverse childhood experiences was the simple question, "What happened to you?" For years, the medical and mental health fields have focused on the question, "What is WRONG with you?"</p>
          <p>Perhaps, if health care systems shift the triage/intake questions to what happened to you, more people will seek help? The inadequate feeling that there might be something wrong with them looms in the background of their mind and the person may not seek help at all. This book provides a beginning toward opening the mind into how trauma can be treated and how positive outcomes can be possible by shifting the sequence of questioning within the treatment sessions.</p>
          <p>After all, does a person want to feel as if there is something WRONG with them? I think not, a person would like to have validation that, yes, something has happened to them and with "treatment regimen" over time, the adversity can become something that is no longer a threat.</p>
          <p>The beginning of this book is detailed with how an infant experiences trauma. Dr. Perry has discovered this to be false! Infants experience trauma as their brains are just forming concepts about the safety of their world at that time. It is important to save how he proves this to be true for the reader. Sorry, I cannot spoil this book for others, it is in the individual's own reading that true and unbiased opinions and realizations will develop independent of my own professional and personal opinion on this topic.</p>

I would recommend it 1000 times and I have told all of my colleagues and friends about it. Please purchase it. The ending is bittersweet it was hard to read. Honestly, I had to do it in pauses, but once I got into it, it was amazing.</p>

          <p>I came across this book by chance at the start of my healing journey. Now I am aware and have answers to many questions I had over the years. I have a better understanding of how much what happened to me as a child affected me over the years. Unconsciously, it has played a role in my decision making over these many years. I spent many years not remembering and not being able to talk about anything painful.</p>
          <p>Growing up in a house where kids should be seen and not heard. He would rather me be dead. While the one parent has, and continues, to be compliant and obedient to her husband for the most part. That's what I learned and grew up doing as well. Putting up with the abuse until I get so depressed I would rather be dead. My breaking point, with so much anger towards myself is when I make myself gain the strength to leave.</p>
          <p>Being the youngest child, I have been abused verbally and physically by the siblings over these years. Even as an adult. I was molested by one as a child. I was labeled as the "bad kid" at an early age in school. Not knowing at the time I was unconsciously trying to bring attention to myself and what was going on at the time. No one cared. Zero cares when I got a poem published in the school newspaper about me being dead.</p>
          <p>I grew up during a time that you either have resilience to make something of yourself or stay the weekest link. A time when no one cared. Mental health was a taboo or bs. A time that self harm was for attention and not seen as a coping mechanism for painful trauma.</p>
          <p>Now I'm making what happened to me matter and addressing it. I've been unknowingly locked up in the painful trauma for years. Having to pretend to be fine being around the abusers. Even after remembering. It was hard to stand my ground at first. It's getting easier the more I learn so I can heal. Figuring out how to move on carrying this burden is the hardest part. I'm still working on the healing.</p>
