            <p>This book is extremely well done. As an individual trained in CBT, I can say that it is very accurate to the school and methodology. It explains things very well, in a way that is understandable to people who don't know a lot about the field, in fact I have quoted from it in therapy sessions to help explain concepts to clients! In addition it can be useful for working things out on your own, I've found the worksheets very helpful in dealing with some of my own anxious thoughts. An excellent book, and would highly recommend.</p>

            <p>Keep this in every therapy office as a go to reference for every therapist & it gets heavy use especially from those newer to doing therapy. Many take it home often to read & look at when need ideas U don't need the workbook just this book. I would definitely use this to teach CBT. Great refresher & useful for clients. If it helps I am a Licensed Psychologist (Ph.D) many of our therapist s are LCSW & Licensed Professional Counselors so great no matter what your background.</p>

            <p>I use this book faithfully with my clientele' due to how much it is broken down to its most minute concept. The homework assignments in it are so easy to follow and breaks down the various illnesses so well such as depression, anger, anxiety and other ailments that client's really have that "AHA" moment when doing the homework. If they don't, they just don 't want to.</p>
            <p>I have purchased more of the "Dummies" series books and they have helped. Some clients have returned my books in favor of purchasing their own so they could highlight in them and share informatino with familymembers and other.</p>

            <p>I cannot say enough good things about this. Its a workbook with forms that you can fill out to work through problems and discover what your inclination is on thought processes. It helps you to change the way you look at things. Its also very insightful about the inclinations that many people have. You can discover the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. I'm very happy that I ordered this. Its a wonderful complement to the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy For Dummies book. The two of them should be ordered together in my opinion.</p>

I really enjoy how they took into consideration that everyone learns differently and use multiple techniques to explain with introductions in each chapter, definitions, pictures, scenarios, examples, followed by worksheets and quick summaries. Very helpful and never boring. I would definitely recommend!</p>

            <p>I'm all for Cognitive Therapy, I have done it myself and found huge success in my personal and professional life. I can handle things with so much ease, it's now second nature. I strongly recommend this book for every parent and every child who is struggling with whatever problem. Cognitive Therapy is for everybody. It's the answer to a medication free fight against anxiety and depression. I purchased it for a friend of mine but she wasn't ready for it, my mum also rejected it which was a shame because I know, really know that it would have turned their lives around 180 degrees. My daughter in law took it gladly and she is now reaping the benefits.</p>

            <p>Lear's book is a continuation of Freud's "metapsychology," offering new ways to conceptualize some of what happens in psychoanalysis. His starting point is one which would seem obvious but is in fact rare in psychoanalytic writings... he offers some brilliant insights, especially about subjectivity vs. "objectivity" and about transference. But Lear's book is an "easy read" because the writing is loose and casual... While his style is a refreshing change from the professional, impersonal prose of most analytic monographs, he also seems to address his peers as though they were laypersons.</p>

            <p>I was waiting a while to see if anyone was going to rate this book before making the decision to part with so much money but with no ratings forthcoming I decided to take the plunge and am so glad I did. There is so much useful information in this gem of a book, particularly for resourcing clients who have developmental trauma and attachment wounds. With a lot of current discussion around IFS, parts and polyvagal theory this text seems to tie it all together in a really useable way. I will never think of Kintsugi in the same way again, and my clients have also really loved this analogy. I know this is a book I will keep going back to so money definitely well spent.

            <p>After Tversky and Kahneman we thought that our brains were full of defects like swiss cheese. The author shows that it is not so much so. Our brains fail in simple logic at times because it uses too much information and its own rational not because of its defects. The conclusion of his research is that under uncertainity 'trained' gut feelings give faster and better results than rational thinking. The author gives hints about building 'adaptive toolbox' with rule of thumbs which is the objective of training the gut feelings. Author certainly contributes to a new chapter in decision making with his original research. I recommend the book highly for everyone.</p>

            <p>This is an excellent book by a UK psychodynamic psychotherapist. The biggest problem with CBT, from my perspective of having worked in the NHS since 1995 (not as a psychodynamic psychotherapist), is that CBT doesn't work for people with severe and enduring psychiatric illnesses ('real patients'), at all. This is contrary to received wisdom from the CBT faithful, the academics who promote CBT and carefully avoid real patients, and who use (as the book explains so clearly) what appears superficially to be the scientific method to justify their CBT product.</p>
            <p>The bad news is that in the real world, no psychotherapy including CBT 'works' better than placebo, and medication works well for a few patients ('service users' is the official NICE term in the UK) but not well, or not at all, for most NHS 'service users'.</p>
            <p>At least with medications safety and efficacy clinical trials came first, before the medications were introduced into routine NHS use with patients. In contrast, all psychotherapies including CBT were introduced first and clinical trials done later to try and justify their increased use, promoted by partisan academics with personal career 'success' as their goal. With medications in the UK, there is a robust surveillance system for adverse effects, and people have to be trainned, qualified, and registered, to prescribe (doctors). In contrast, there is no surveillance system for psychotherapy harms (which exist), and there are no mandatory trainning, qualifications, and registration, for "therapists" to work in the UK. As the book describes, the requisite clinical trial design to reduce bias (concluding a treatment is effective when its not) is the double blind randomised placebo-controlled trial, yet this is impossible in CBT and with all other psychotherapies. This means unbiased evidence for CBT efficacy is just not there which the book explains well.</p>
            <p>The current UK system denies or just ignores all the above, meaning real problems can not even be acknowledged, which is a pre-requisite for progress and better treatments. This results in the current 'faith based' system of NHS 'treatments', masquerading as evidence-based medicine and clinical psychology, which comprises NHS 'mental health'. The book provides an excellent overview.</p>
            <p>Limitations of the book are that it doesn't discriminate 'real patients' from the worried well (the former have an average reduction in life expectancy in the UK of 15 to 20 years, with only 5% deaths due to suicide, according to official UK government figures - the latter don't), and gets a few aspects of science and medicine a bit wrong. However, the vast majority of the book is entirely accurate and very clear and I hope the book is widely read.</p>

            <p>This timely book offers an engaging and comprehensive introduction to a simple, but powerfully effective, expressive psychotherapeutic modality - written by one of its current master practitioners. Chairwork is a psychotherapeutic technique, with roots in Psychodrama and Gestalt Therapy, that uses chairs to signify aspects of an individuals life in need of reconciliation. The creative use of empty chairs can spatially differentiate and evoke conflicted voices - both external and internal - allowing them to more fully enter into clarifying dialogues that can facilitate resolution and healing.</p>
            <p>Scott Kellogg reveals that this therapeutic art has played a central role in the history of expressive therapies and continues to be incorporated into various therapeutic approaches, especially the growing number that recognize the importance of working with inner ‘parts’. By tracing the development of this ‘empty chair’ technique, Kellogg provides us with a long overdue historical orientation that makes for fascinating reading and establishes this method within larger currents of theory and practice.</p>

Dr Scott Kellogg has written a brilliantly clear and compelling case for the power of chair work to resolve and integrate splits and transform lives. I have used Chairwork in my own therapy and found it both powerful and immediate. Chair work allows both client and worker/therapist deal with some very deep issues in a safe and collaborative way and through this book and the training I have discovered new ways of working. Dr Kellogg not only outlines what Chairwork but the book has numerous examples of client-therapist dialogue which enables the reader to consider the applicability to their own clients.

This book gives a fabulous short history of chair work and explains contemporary developments.

Subjects covered include trauma and expression of anger. I only wish this book was twice as long. I do, however, feel that it is expensive.</p>
