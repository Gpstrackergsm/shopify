          <div class="review-meta">Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2022 · Format: Paperback · Verified Purchase</div>
          <div class="review-body">
            <p>Not only have I found this program to be salvation, I participated in the study with Dr. Lisa Najavits at Harvard/McLean.</p>
            <p>The program works but it requires a commitment from the patient. Each visit requires an outside commitment which the patient chooses. It can be speaking to a conflicted family member, applying for a job, reading pertinent documents, really anything that will keep you moving forward. I chose to write, focusing on how my life was formed by trauma and the uselessness of self medication.</p>
            <p>The premise is to be made to feel safe during sessions and the well trained therapist with whom I met three times a week was good at this. In order to re-visit past trauma, a necessity in healing, you must feel safe.</p>
            <p>This manual is a breakthrough for treatment.</p>

          <div class="review-meta">Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2016 · Format: Paperback · Verified Purchase</div>
          <div class="review-body">
            <p>A must-have manual for anyone working in the field of addiction and recovery. Many individuals seeking treatment for substance abuse have experienced some form of trauma in their lives, and even those who don't meet criteria for PTSD or haven't experienced a really significant trauma can still benefit from the lessons and activities in this workbook.</p>
            <p>I am a counselor and used this book with clients both in groups and in an individual setting. I find this book particularly effective in groups because the topic of trauma can be difficult in groups, people are sometimes reluctant to share their most painful memories in front of others. But this workbook helps turn the focus onto healing and growth, as well as healthy ways to protect yourself and prevent retraumatization (thus the "seeking safety" title).</p>
            <p>I really cannot recommend this book enough, it is worth every penny and I have gotten a LOT of good use out of it and plan to continue to do so.</p>

            <p>Excellent treatment manual for treating substance abuse and post traumatic stress disorder. It is true that in my own practice I very frequently see comorbid trauma and substance use. The manual does an excellent job of disseminating information and providing effective treatment methods in a very clear and precise manner. This manual can be easily utilized in practice as a supplement to non-directive therapy. The manual offers 18 (if I remember correctly) group or individually oriented treatment programs as well as comprehensive information regarding the nature of comorbid PTSD and substance use disorders. I would strongly recommend this manual as an entry point into treating individual of all backgrounds, particularly for substance abuse treatment centers.</p>

            <p>This workbook is so beautifully organized and easy to use. It offers 25 topics for group or individual therapy, along with worksheets and an outline on how to conduct the group. The first 60 pages are background and the rest of the book are the actual sessions and handouts. One person I know had her book spiral bound for ease of copying the worksheets. With the purchase of the book, the author give copyrights to the owner to use the material in group.</p>

          <div class="review-body">
            <p>I'm using this book as a ciriculum for its target population. Overall, the flexibly structured approach is super helpful for a group in various stages of recovery and most topics we have used have produced fruitful insight for many patients. However, the book needs an update to integrate interventions from DBT into the handouts to be more relevant to the work of contemporary clinicians. I would also prefer an elimination of editorial opinions presented as facts: the section on PTSD contains several which, informed by 20 years of practice, I find untrue or potentially shaming. Needless to say, those tidbits were removed from the handouts my group received.</p>

            <p>Practical guide to running psychoeducational groups for persons with PTSD and substance abuse. Acknowledged in the field. Provides hand outs for each meeting, discussion points, you could even read a chapter verbatim for a group meeting, and how to deal with difficult or challenging persons on a given topic. The section on grounding, methods to calm a person experiencing panic, is excellent. A great guide for counselors in training, persons who are in recovery, trauma survivors, as well as for professional counselors for ideas and directions for leading groups.

            <p>I rarely write reviews, but felt compelled to do so in praise of this protocol. I've spent the last year working at a community mental health site for clients with substance abuse disorders. Seeking Safety is, hands down, the BEST resource I've found to work with clients and elicit change. It's intended to be used in group settings, but I've also found the materials to be useful in individual therapy. If you're working with clients with substance abuse/PTSD, you will not regret purchasing this book.</p>

            <p>I purchased this as a patient but I think it will be okay. No jargon so far and really helpful worksheets. If you feel lost by the distance between these two diagnoses this book will really help. It is the basis for support groups and excerpts used in my IOP, so considered top rate by professionals. A very compassionate work.</p>

            <p>This is an extremely basic text that anyone with a therapeutic background and/or a long history teaching standard treatment groups will not get much from. It in fact seems to me to be geared toward the non-professional who may encounter clients with a history of trauma. I sent it back for a refund, having expected more from the large price tag and general esteem often ascribed to this text.</p>
            <p>It is also quite wordy, and covers a broad array of situations one may find themselves in while facilitating. To some this with be helpful, to others it will feel like a slog. That being said, like so many treatment group guides, some sessions seem to lack sufficient depth and do not grant much reflective capacity to the client (i.e. many of my clients would find large portions of it condescending and/or out of touch). My final cringe moment was coming across this example from a worksheet: "Working as a prostitute is making my PTSD worse; I need to stop." With all of the clients I have worked with with a substance abuse and PTSD history who were involved in sex work, I can't think of one of them that would appreciate this example or take it seriously.</p>
            <p><em>[About a year after writing this review, an institution I work with started using this curriculum as the basis for one of its groups. The facilitator, who identifies as being in addiction recovery and who has a preference for a harm reduction approach and mindfulness-based therapies, told me it reads as someone trying to understand their own journey and that it seems to come from a good place. However, he found much of the language around addiction frustrating and offensive. He said he couldn't just present the curriculum as is because it wouldn't go over well with this population (mostly veterans) and he couldn't ethically support it as is. Therefore, he uses it to process and some of the processing is about the stigmatizing language that shows up on the worksheets.]</em></p>
            <p>The organization is relatively clear even if the printing makes scanning for what you're looking for a chore. The worksheets look ancient. The beginner will still find this useful and, if still intrigued, I would highly recommend getting the used or discounted version and preparing to use this supplementally to pad existing curriculum.</p>
            <p>I want to add as an aside that each lesson begins with a quote. These quotes do not point to source material. I attempted to track a quote ostensibly made by the Buddha. It took some time to arrive at a Buddhist scholar's blog discussing this as an often misattributed quote, with some discussion about how and from where it may have emerged. Maybe nobody else cares that such a highly esteemed workbook plays fast and loose with words (including here the direct quote above), but this overall comes across as shoddy work from my perspective as a curriculum developer, an academic, and an educator.</p>

            <p>My husband is a soldier. A soldier that was getting punished for having PTSD and it's symptoms. I knew something was wrong about that and as I researched I realized he was not alone. The Army does not treat them together. My research led me to Seeking Safety. I was worried that I would not be able to understand it's language but for the most part I could. I have also been able to use it for my husband who is now recovering better than from any treatment the Army has tried to provide. The only thing I don't care for is the use of AA/NA being stressed. There are other recovery options available that are also successful and not based in religion or having a higher power. So obviously in those areas we just substitute the recovery program of our choice. I have now carried this book to meetings with Officers that can affect change in the system hoping that it will catch on and they will start to use it's model.</p>
