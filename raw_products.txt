Troubled Persons Industries : The Expansion of Psychiatric Categories Beyond Psychiatry
 Martin Harbusch

"This book critiques the use of psychiatric labelling and psychiatric narratives in everyday areas of institutional and social life across the globe. It engages an interpretive sociology, emphasising the medial and individual everyday practices of medicalisation, and their role in establishing and diffusing conceptions of mental (ab)normality. The reconstruction of psychiatric narratives is currently taking place in multiple contexts, many of which are no longer strictly psychiatric. On the one hand, psychiatric narratives now pervade contemporary public discourses and institutions though advertising, news and internet sites. On the other hand, professionals like social workers, teachers, counsellors, disability advisors, lawyers, nurses and/or health insurance staff dealing with psychiatric narratives are becoming servants of the psychiatric discourse within troubled persons industries. Abstract academic categories get turned into concrete aggrieved victims of these categorisations and academic formulas turned into individual narratives. To receive support it seems, one must be labelled. The practice-oriented micro-sociological field with which this volume is concerned has only recently begun to integrate itself into public and academic debates regarding medicalisation and the social role of psychiatry. Discussions on the evolution and expansion of official diagnoses within academia, and society in general, frequently overlook the individualised roles of psychiatric...Read more…

Soviet Psychology : History, Theory, Content
 John Mcleish

Originally published in 1975, this title sets out to show us the differences between Soviet and other ways of thinking about nature, man, and society. The basic factor distinguishing Soviet psychology is that it views phenomena from the perspective of a highly articulated body of theoretical assumptions, and rejects the inductive ¿eclecticism¿ of Western psychology. The theoretical framework within which Soviet psychology functions is the product of a distinctive socio-political and cultural development in Russia profoundly shaped by the institutions of autocracy and Orthodox religion, and the economic system of serfdom, and the radical revolt which grew up in opposition to this and advocated materialism, secularism, and atheism. This radical philosophic tradition in Russia, best represented by the writings of Chernishevski, fused with the doctrines of Marxism and the new science of behaviour developed by Sechenov and Pavlov to create the theoretical framework of Soviet psychology. The book also analyses the discussions, controversies, and decrees which are at the root of the contemporary science of behaviour in the Soviet Union, and points to the impressive body of empirical knowledge which has arisen. Soviet Psychology is unique in presenting Soviet psychology from an ¿inside¿ point of view, and in making us appreciate the strongly theoretical stance of Soviet psychology which Professor McLeish claims is unlikely to be much influenced by the new atmosphere of d¿nte.Read more…

Silence and Silencing in Psychoanalysis : Cultural, Clinical, and Research Perspectives
 Aleksandar Dimitrijević (Editor), Michael B. Buchholz (Editor)

This book is the first comprehensive treatment in recent decades of silence and silencing in psychoanalysis from clinical and research perspectives, as well as in philosophy, theology, linguistics, and musicology. The book approaches silence and silencing on three levels. First, it provides context for psychoanalytic approaches to silence through chapters about silence in phenomenology, theology, linguistics, musicology, and contemporary Western society. Its central part is devoted to the position of silence in psychoanalysis: its types and possible meanings (a form of resistance, in countertransference, the foundation for listening and further growth), based on both the work of the pioneers of psychoanalysis and on clinical case presentations. Finally, the book includes reports of conversation analytic research of silence in psychotherapeutic sessions and everyday communication. Not only are original techniques reported here for the first time, but research and clinical approaches fit together in significant ways. This book will be of interest to all psychologists, psychoanalysts, and social scientists, as well as applied researchers, program designers and evaluators, educators, leaders, and students. It will also provide valuable insight to anyone interested in the social practices of silence and silencing, and the roles these play in everyday social interactions.Read more…

Taming the Negative Introject : Empowering Patients to Take Control of Their Mental Health
 Carol W Berman

"In this book, Dr. Carol W. Berman describes how to help patients control the self-sabotaging element of their unconscious minds, often called the punitive superego, the negative introject, or the hurt child. The negative introject can provoke horrendous acts against the self, ranging from suicide and addiction to making hurtful comments to loved ones. The role of the psychotherapist is to make the unconscious conscious, allowing the sufferers to take back control of their actions. Dr. Berman uses case studies to personalize the theory and demonstrate how the negative introject can take hold and impact the lives of those suffering from a variety of illnesses and disorders, including depression, anxiety, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Each chapter concludes with a guide demonstrating how the negative introject was tamed in each case, showing the reader that the negative introject can be identified and then brought into some control. This book is essential reading for all kinds of psychotherapists, from psychiatrists to social workers and psychologists, as well as all those who wish to identify the negative introject, and help "tame" it."Read more…

Future Psychoanalysis : Toward a Psychology of the Human Subject
 Ahmed Fayek

A crisis in psychoanalysis has been developing since the 1970s, manifesting in a gradual but persistent loss of patients and young mental health providers in psychoanalytic training and therapy. In a peculiar way, the Freudian informative theory of psychoanalysis has been going through a parallel crisis of its own. There have been internal disagreements and differences among analysts about how to develop the theory and protect the profession of psychoanalysis. The internal disputes have resulted in chaotic theoretical plurality, which replaced classical informative theory. In spite of obvious and serious concerns about these crises, none of the solutions has been useful.Future Psychoanalysis: Toward a Psychology of the Human Subject focuses on the future of psychoanalysis considering its current critical condition. The informative theory of psychoanalysis has reached its limits, but its structural base offers a comprehensive theory, promising fruitful future psychoanalysis. It is a theory of the structural foundation of the intrapsychical core of the human subject. Since the human sciences are currently adopting the structural outlook in their fields of research, psychoanalysis could join the humanities as one of its fields, not just as a clinical profession that is parasitically linked to the more active idiographic fields of epistemology. Future Psychoanalysis introduces a structural theory of psychoanalysis to replace the demising informative theory and points to where...Read more…

Shamanic Dimensions of Psychotherapy : Healing Through the Symbolic Process
 Robin Van Löben Sels

In __Shamanic Dimensions of Psychotherapy: Healing through the Symbolic Process,__ Robin van Löben Sels uniquely and honestly recounts her personal journey toward a shamanic understanding of psychotherapy. Exploring the disruptive breakthrough of visions and dreams that occurred during her analysis, personal life, and psychoanalytic training, van Löben Sels illustrates how the phenomenology of ancient shamanism is still alive and how it is a paradigm for the emergence and maturation of the psyche in people today. This original book delves into van Löben Sels’s personal experience of the shaman, identifying such eruptions as a contemporary version of the archaic shaman’s initiatory call to vocation. The book is split into two parts. It begins by outlining the shamanic personality in history, recognizing this as an individual that has been called out of a collectively sanctioned identity into a creative life, and the unconscious shaman complex they consequently face, especially in psychotherapeutic relationships. Practical as well as theoretical, the second part outlines the shamanic attributes that underline psychotherapeutic relationships - silence, sound, mask, rhythm, gesture, movement, and respiration - and usefully describes how to use them as __asanas__ for consciousness, or vehicles toward psychological awareness. With clinical examples and personal stories throughout, this book’s unique Jungian perspective addresses contemporary expressions of the shaman complex in...Read more…

Romantic Metasubjectivity Through Schelling and Jung: Rethinking the Romantic Subject (Philosophy and Psychoanalysis)
 Gord Barentsen

__Romantic Metasubjectivity Through Schelling and Jung: Rethinking the Romantic Subject__ exploresthe remarkable intellectual isomorphism between the philosophy of Friedrich Schelling and Carl Jung’s analytical psychology in order to offer a crucial and original corrective to the "reflection theory" of subjectivity. Arguing that the reflection theory of the subject does not do justice to the full compass of Romantic thinking about the human being, __Romantic Metasubjectivity__ sees human identity as neither discursive aftereffect nor centred around a self-transparent "I" but rather as constellated around the centripetal force of what Novalis calls "The Self of one’s self." The author begins with a unique reading of Schelling’s early __Naturphilosophie__ as primal site rather than Freudian scene, thinking this site through his __Philosophical Inquiries Into the Nature of Human Freedom__ to __The Ages of the World__. Reading Jungian metapsychology and its core concepts as therapeutic amplifications of Schelling, the author articulates an intellectual counter-transference in which Schelling and Jung contemporise each other. The book then demonstrates how Romantic metasubjectivity operates in the libidinal matrix of Romantic poetry through readings of William Wordsworth’s __The Prelude__ and Percy Shelley’s __Prometheus Unbound__. The book concludes with a discussion of the hit TV series __Breaking Bad__ as a "case study" of the challenges Romantic metasubjectivity raises for...Read more…

The Soul Always Thinks (Collected English Papers, Vol. 4)
 Wolfgang Giegerich

"C. G. Jung regarded the soul to be a reality in its own right which reflects itself in all manner of images and events. symbols and traditions. In this fourth volume of his Collected English Papers, Giegerich recalls the soul to the inwardness of its own home territory by bringing out the thought-character of the self-creating, self-unfolding logical life that it is. In addition to clarifying what thought means for psychology and analyzing certain misconceptions surrounding the topic of "soul and thought" a challenging thesis concerning the limitation of an imaginal, "anima-only" approach in psychology (given the essential historicity of the soul) is carefully argued, while examining at the same time such topics as "the end of meaning and the birth of man," "anima mundi and time", "the metamorphosis of the gods," and the logical steps involved in the transition from childhood to adulthood and from a psychological oneness with nature to modern alienation from nature. The book also discusses the notion of the soul's logical life and shows in action the psychological procedure of "absolute-negative interiorization" of phenomena into their soul and truth in a number of in-depth examinations of particular phenomena (e.g. Heraclitus' dictum about the soul's depth, the "leap into the solid stone," the negativity of the "stone which is not a stone"). In thorough-going critical engagements with other authors in the field, it demonstrates specific instances where psychology fails...Read more…

Alchemy and Psychotherapy : Post-Jungian Perspectives
 Mathers, Dale

Alchemical symbols are part of popular culture, most recently popularised in the Harry Potter books. Alchemy intrigued Carl Jung, the founder of analytical psychology. It inspired him as he wrote ‘the Red Book'- the journal of his voyage of internal discovery. He devoted much of his life to it, using alchemical symbols as metaphors for unconscious processes. Alchemy and Psychotherapy explores the issue of alchemy in the consulting room and its application to social and political issues. This book argues against the dominant discourse in contemporary psychotherapy - scientific materialism - and for the discovery of spiritual meaning. Alchemy and Psychotherapy has four main sections: ‘Alchemy and meaning'- looks at the history of alchemy, particularly the symbol of the coniunctio - sacred marriage - a metaphor for the therapeutic relationship.'The symbolic attitude'- explores working with dreams, fairytales, astrology and the body: each of which is a symbolic language. ‘The spirit and the natural world'- discusses the concept of'burn out'- of therapists, our ecological resources, the mystical aspects of quantum physics and the philosophical underpinning of symbol formation. ‘Clinical Applications'- shows alchemy's use with victims of abuse, those struggling to secure gender identity, in anorexia and in ‘social healing'- atonement and restorative justice - which apply the idea of the coniunctio. Alchemy and Psychotherapy is illustrated throughout with clinical examples,...Read more…

The Book of My Son Reuben : A Psychologist on the Loss of His Child
 David. Cohen

"I wish I had not had to write this book because then my lovely son Reuben would still be alive," says David Cohen. "He was adorable, formidably intelligent, a loving son, a loving brother. He died far too young. He had the bad luck to have two grandparents who had addictive personalities. His efforts to resist the lure of drugs failed. And so did I." __The Book of My Son Reuben__ is a personal account of how psychologist David Cohen coped – and did not cope – with the death of his son, Reuben. Offering a unique perspective on the experience of parental loss, it offers a personal and analytical exploration of sorrow and guilt, and of what research tells us about trauma and grief. Illustrated throughout with David Cohen’s personal insight into how he continues to navigate his loss, this honest book provides a deeper understanding of loss for parents who have experienced it, as well as those who support them. The book remembers the many parents who have lost children throughout history and chapters weave personal perspectives with the latest research. It examines the experience of sudden deaths, the failures of society in preventing children from dying, the role of social media, how the loss of a child impacts fathers, siblings and relationships, and the usefulness – or otherwise – of bereavement therapies. A tribute to Reuben’s life, this sensitive volume is for those who have experienced loss and want to gain better understanding of their experience, as well as...Read more…

Unformulated Experience: From Dissociation to Imagination in Psychoanalysis (Relational Perspectives Book) (Relational Perspectives Book Series)
 Donnel B. Stern

In this powerful and wonderfully accessible meditation on psychoanalysis, hermeneutics, and social constructivism, Donnel Stern explores the relationship between two fundamental kinds of experience: explicit verbal reflection and "unformulated experience," or experience we have not yet reflected on and put into words. Stern is especially concerned with the process by which we come to formulate the unformulated. It is not an instrumental task, he holds, but one that requires openness and curiosity; the result of the process is not accuracy alone, but experience that is deeply felt and fully imagined. Stern's sense of explicit verbal experience as continuously constructed and emergent leads to a central dialectic at the heart of his work: that between curiosity and imagination, on one hand, and dissociation and unthinking acceptance of the familiar on the other. The goal of psychoanalytic work, he holds, is the freedom to be curious, whereas defense signifies the denial of this freedom. We defend against our fear of what we would think, that is, if we allowed ourselves the freedom to think it. Stern also shows how the unconscious itself can be reconceptualized hermeneutically, and he goes on to explore the implications of this viewpoint on interpretation and countertransference. He is especially persuasive in showing how the interpersonal field, which is continuously in flux, limits the experience that it is possible for participants to reflect on. Thus it is that analyst...Read more…

Alchemy and Psychotherapy has four main sections: ‘Alchemy and meaning'- looks at the history of alchemy, particularly the symbol of the coniunctio - sacred marriage - a metaphor for the therapeutic relationship.'The symbolic attitude'- explores working with dreams, fairytales, astrology and the body: each of which is a symbolic language. ‘The spirit and the natural world'- discusses the concept of'burn out'- of therapists, our ecological resources, the mystical aspects of quantum physics and the philosophical underpinning of symbol formation. ‘Clinical Applications'- shows alchemy's use with victims of abuse, those struggling to secure gender identity, in anorexia and in ‘social healing'- atonement and restorative justice - which apply the idea of the coniunctio. Alchemy and Psychotherapy is illustrated throughout with clinical examples,...Read more…

The Interpretation of Dreams : The Complete and Definitive Text
 Sigmund Freud; Translated From The German And Edited By James Strachey

The most complete edition of Sigmund Freud's classic work on the psychology and significance of dreams. What are the most common dreams and why do we have them? What does a dream about death mean? What do dreams of swimming, failing, or flying symbolize? First published in 1899, Sigmund Freud's groundbreaking book The Interpretation of Dreams explores why we dream and why dreams matter in our psychological lives. Delving into theories of manifest and latent dream content; the special language of dreams; dreams as wish fulfillments; the significance of childhood experiences; and much more, Freud offers an incisive and enduringly relevant examination of dream psychology. Encompassing dozens of case histories and detailed analyses of actual dreams, this landmark work grants us unique insight into our sleeping experiences. Renowned for translating Freud's German writings into English, James Strachey―with the assistance of Freud's daughter Anna―first published this edition in 1953. Incorporating all textual alterations made by Freud over a period of thirty years, it remains the most complete translation of the work in print.Read more…

The Absent Father Effect on Daughters : Father Desire, Father Wounds
 Susan E. Schwartz [Schwartz, Susan E.]

The Absent Father Effect on Daughters investigates the impact of absent - physically or emotionally - and inadequate fathers on the lives and psyches of their daughters through the perspective of Jungian analytical psychology. This book tells the stories of daughters who describe the insecurity of self, the splintering and disintegration of the personality, and the silencing of voice. Issues of fathers and daughters reach to the intra-psychic depths and archetypal roots, to issues of self and culture, both personal and collective. Susan E. Schwartz illustrates the maladies and disappointments of daughters who lack a father figure and incorporates clinical examples describing how daughters can break out of idealizations, betrayals, abandonments and losses to move towards repair and renewal. The book takes an interdisciplinary approach, expanding and elucidating Jungian concepts through dreams, personal stories, fairy tales and the poetry of Sylvia Plath, along with psychoanalytic theory, including Andre Green's 'dead father effect' and Julia Kristeva's theories on women and the body as abject. Examining daughters both personally and collectively affected by the lack of a father, The Absent Father Effect on Daughters is highly relevant for those wanting to understand the complex dynamics of daughters and fathers to become their authentic selves. It will be essential reading for anyone seeking understanding, analytical and depth psychologists, other therapy professionals,...Read more…

Critical Realism for Psychologists
 David Pilgrim, David Pilgrim

This is the first dedicated text to explain and explore the utility of critical realism for psychologists, offering it as a helpful middle ground between positivism and postmodernism. By introducing its basic concepts, Pilgrim explains critical realism to psychologists and shows how the interface between the natural and social worlds, and the internal and external, can be used to examine human life. This both/and aspect of human life is important in another sense: we are both determined and determining beings, making choices but within the material constraints of both our bodies and the social context of our unique existence. The book offers an exploration of academic and applied psychology with that inward and outward curiosity in mind, beginning with the premise that both inner and outer reality are the legitimate interest of psychologists. In doing so, it shows how critical realism endorses the remaining advantages of positivism and postmodernism, while discarding their philosophical errors. A range of case studies are presented to show how psychologists can use critical realism when working with real life problems, as researchers or practitioners.Read more…

Eavesdropping : The Psychotherapist in Film and Television
 Lucy Huskinson (Editor), Terrie Waddell (Editor)

What can depictions of psychotherapy on screen teach us about ourselves? In　Eavesdropping, a selection of contributions from internationally-based film consultants, practicing psychotherapists and interdisciplinary scholars investigate the curious dynamics that occur when films and television programmes attempt to portray the psychotherapist, and the complexities of psychotherapy, for popular audiences. The book evaluates the potential mismatch between the onscreen psychotherapist, whose raison d'être is to entertain and engage global audiences, and the professional, real-life counterpart, who becomes intimately involved with the dramas of their patients. While several contributors conclude that actual psychotherapy, and the way psychotherapists and their clients grapple with notions of fantasy and reality, would make a rather poor show,　Eavesdropping　demonstrates the importance of psychotherapy and psychotherapists on-screen in assisting us to wrestle with the discomfort – and humour - of our lives. Offering a unique insight into perceptions of psychotherapy,　Eavesdropping　will be essential and insightful reading for analytical psychologists, psychoanalysts, academics and students of depth psychology, film and television studies, media studies and literature, as well as filmmakers.Read more…

C. G. Jung and the Scientific Attitude
 Edmund D. Cohen

C.G. Jung and the Scientific Attitude is a survey and assessment of the contributions of the great Swiss psychiatrist. Since its viewpoint is that of an historian of psychology rather than that of a practitioner, stress is placed on the conceptual consistency of Jung's approach, and the fundamental philosophical differences that separate it from most other works in psychology. Metatheoretical questions and implicit criticism of the narrow metatheoretical presuppositions that have so deleteriously affected academic psychology, pervade it. The first three chapters correspond to the three major phases of Jung's creative career; respectively, they deal with the psychological complex, the personality typology, and the often-misunderstood concept of the collective unconscious. The fourth chapter covers Jung's involvement with ESP and occult phenomena, and from that point of departure goes deeply into the question, what kind of undertaking a science of the psyche must be. The fifth chapter is concerned with the application of Jung's ideas to important social problems, such as aggression, racism, women's' problems, and drugs. The origins of the persistent slanders of anti-Semitism and pro-Nazi sympathy against Jung are taken up. The sixth chapter examines the connections between Jung's psychology and academic psychology, and shows some areas where academic psychology might benefit from Jung's influence in the future. The seventh chapter is about the problem of applying Jung's...Read more…

Psychopathia Sexualis : The Classic Study of Deviant Sex
 Richard Von Krafft-Ebing, Joseph Lopiccolo

Preceding Freud’s __Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex__ by more than twenty years, Richard von Krafft-Ebing’s __Psychopathia Sexualis__ pioneered the psychological study of sexual behavior. This classic nineteenth-century work on sexual aberration addressed such previously taboo subjects as bestiality, cunnilingus and fellatio, fetishism, incest, masochism, masturbation, nymphomania, and sadism, making it the first serious attempt to catalog and define such deviations.” For almost one hundred years, __Psychopathia Sexualis__ stood as the world’s most informative volume on the subject of sexual deviation. Arguably the most important precursor to Freud in the study of human sexuality, Krafft-Ebing introduced ideas and concepts that greatly influenced the works of Alfred Kinsey and Masters and Johnson. In his own time Krafft-Ebing was both praised and damned for this volume. Some psychiatrists denounced the work as an immoral apology for perversion and deviance, while others recognized the immense service the author had done for an unjustly neglected area of study. Although sometimes dated by the beliefs and state of knowledge of the time it was written, __Psychopathia Sexualis__ is essential (and immensely entertaining) as one of the most important documents in humankind’s modern effort to understand itself.Read more…

Essential Psychodynamic Psychotherapy : An Acquired Art
 Teri Quatman

Essential Psychodynamic Psychotherapy : An Acquired Art provides an essential, accessible grounding in current psychodynamic theory and practice for a wide range of readers. For trainees, it offers a very useful toolset to help them make the transition from purely theoretical training to the uncharted territory of clinical practice. For more seasoned therapists and those seeking to deepen their understanding of psychodynamic therapy, it provides conceptual clarity, and may also serve as a stepping stone to more complex and denser psychoanalytic works written for advanced clinicians. Essential Psychodynamic Psychotherapy: An Acquired Art is an introduction to how to think and work psychodynamically. It is written primarily for those training at a postgraduate level in psychoanalysis and psychodynamic psychotherapy, but reaches well beyond that audience. It is grounded in contemporary psychoanalytic theory, drawing on the work of Winnicott, Bion, and Ogden, all of whom are pivotal in current psychodynamic thought and practice. It also integrates attachment theory and research, and includes fresh contributions from neuropsychological research. The voice of the book is honest and intimate. The tone is practical. It is written with a clear-minded understanding of contemporary psychodynamic theory that allows the new therapist to access the deepest and richest parts of the therapy itself. It translates many of the key theoretical tenets of psychodynamic psychotherapy,...Read more…

The Power of Mindful Learning (A Merloyd Lawrence Book)
 Ellen J. Langer, Ellen J. Langer

"Radical in its implications, this original and important work may change forever the views we hold about the nature of learning. In The Power of Mindful Learning, Ellen Langer uses her innovative theory of mindulness, introduced in her influential earlier book, to dramatically enhance the way we learn. In business, sports, laboratories, or at home, our learning is hobbled by certain antiquated and pervasive misconceptions. In this pithy, liberating, and delightful book she gives us a fresh, new view of learning in the broadest sense. Such familiar notions as delayed gratification, "the basics", or even "right answers", are all incapacitating myths which Langer explodes one by one. She replaces them with her concept of mindful or conditional learning which she demonstrates, with fascinating examples from her research, to be extraordinarily effective. Mindful learning takes place with an awareness of context and of the ever-changing nature of information. Learning without this awareness, as Langer shows convincingly, has severely limited uses and often sets on up for failure. With stunning applications to skills as diverse as paying attention, CPR, investment analysis, psychotherapy, or playing a musical instrument, The Power of Mindful Learning is for all who are curious and intellectually adventurous"-- Provided by publisherRead more…

 Jenna Lejeune; Jason B. Luoma Phd

Values in Practice is powerful and practical guide for any therapist--chock-full of insight and tools to conceptualize, integrate, and effectively apply values work in-session. With an emphasis on cultivating meaning and vitality in client lives, the values component of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is what draws many clinicians to the treatment model.

Self-preservation at the center of personality : superego and ego ideal in the regulation of safety
 Ralf-Peter Behrendt

Annotation The book discusses personality as a unified set of evolved and culturally developed structures that serves a single and definable purpose, to maintain the individual's safety, in the context of dyadic relationships, group processes and more abstract and fluid social configurations. The infant-mother relationship remains the blueprint for modes of relating to the social surround, at whatever level of complexity, and for approximating the sense of safety originally provided by the mother. The personality is organized around the need to maintain self-esteem, thereby preserving the individual's sense of safety and warding off deep-seated paranoid anxiety, which signals the potential of annihilation of the self. Paranoid anxiety is the counterpart of intraspecific aggression and the potential of the group as a whole to attack and annihilate the individual. Paranoid anxiety, which was recognized by Melanie Klein as playing a critical role in infant development, is not overcome as development proceeds but remains latent, buried under layers of personality organization that are essentially concerned with sourcing recognition and approval from the social environment, thereby inhibiting others' aggression and guarding against annihilation of the self. The book adds to self psychology (Kohut) by showing how the principle of self-preservation underpins all aspects of normal and abnormal character dynamics. It integrates self psychology with other branches psychoanalytic...Read more…

The texture of treatment [electronic resource] : on the matter of psychoanalytic technique
 Schlesinger, Herbert J.

In simple, jargon-free language, Herbert Schlesinger sets out to demystify technique, to show how it is based on basic principles that are applicable both to psychoanalysis and to the psychotherapies that derive from it. He has little need for conventional theory; rather, he reframes essential analytic notions - transference, resistance, interpretation, regression, empathy - as processes and assigns technique the goal of promoting the patient's activity within the treatment situation. The aim of the analytic therapist is to restore to the patient active control of his own life. Utilizing basic premises of systems theory, Schlesinger approaches personality and neurosis alike as self-stabilizing systems that can be changed only with persistent effort. Follow-up interpretations that address the patient's responses to previous interpretations are crucial. Similarly, the analyst views the transference as'rules of behavior'the patient has created that limit the freedom of both parties in the treatment. Interpretation speaks to the patient's inability to make full use of the freedom the analytic situation affords to explore how his mind works. Viewing neuroses as what the patient does, rather than what he has, the analyst sees the'resisting'patient not as opposing the treatment but rather doing what the patient feels he must do both to accommodate to the demands of the script of an unconscious fantasy and to provide for his own sense of safety. Beautifully illustrated with...Read more…

REIMAGINING THERAPY THROUGH SOCIAL CONTEXTUAL ANALYSES : finding new ways to support people in... distress
 Bernard. Guerin

This book attempts to ‘shake up’ the current complacency around therapy and ‘mental health’ behaviours by putting therapy fully into context using Social Contextual Analysis; showing how changes to our social, discursive, and societal environments, rather than changes to an individual’s ‘mind’, will reduce suffering from the ‘mental health’ behaviours. Guerin challenges many assumptions about both current therapy and psychology, and offers alternative approaches, synthesized from sociology, social anthropology, sociolinguistics, and elsewhere. The book provides a way of addressing the ‘mental health’ behaviours including actions, talking, thinking, and emotions, by taking people’s external life situations into account, and not relying on an imagined ‘internal source’. Guerin describes the broad contexts for current Western therapies, referring to social, discursive, cultural, societal, and economic contexts, and suggests that we need to research the components of therapies and stop treating therapies as units. He reframes different types of therapy away from their abstract jargons, offering an alternative approach grounded in our real social worlds, aligning with new thinking that challenges the traditional methods of therapy, and also providing a better framework for rethinking psychology itself. The book ultimately suggests more emphasis should be put on ‘mental health’ behaviours as arising from social issues including the modern contexts of extreme capitalism,...Read more…

Performance-Based Family Therapy : A Therapist’s Guide to Measurable Change
 H. Charles. Fishman

In this groundbreaking book, Charles Fishman uniquely incorporates and develops results-based accountability (RBA) into the framework of structural family therapy. Collaborating with the founder of RBA, Mark Friedman, this approach aims to transform the field of family therapy by allowing clinicians to track performance effectively and efficiently with their clients. The book begins by reviewing the historical foundations of family therapy and evaluates why challenges in the field, alternative methods, and the reliance on evidence-based medicine (EBM) have meant that family therapy may not have flourished to the extent that many of us expected. It then explores how RBA can be integrated into intensive structural therapy (IST), with chapters examining how RBA can be applied in context, such as in treating eating disorders, supervision, and how it can be used to transform the professional’s clinical contexts. Relevant and practical, the book also introduces the community resource specialist to help in the treatment of socially disadvantaged families, as well as practical appendices and "tracking tools" to empower clinicians to track their data and choose treatment models that obtain best outcomes. This new approach offers transparent and measurable outcomes for both clinicians and training family therapists, lending a helping hand in making family therapy the gold standard in psychotherapy. It is essential reading for undergraduate and graduate students of family therapy,...Read more…

Autism and The Predictive Brain : Absolute Thinking in a Relative World
 Peter Vermeulen

What if our previous teachings and beliefs regarding processing stimuli, reading emotions and understanding human behaviour is all untrue? In this book, Peter Vermeulen investigates new findings on the predictive brain and what these insights mean for autism and current interventions. Recent research has shown that the classic ideas about how the human brain first needs to process incoming information about the world before it can react are no longer tenable. Rather, to survive in the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment of modern society, what we need is a brain that predicts the world quickly and unconsciously, while taking proper account of the context. This book explains the new theories relating to the predictive brain, summarising some of the more recent highly technical research studies about the predictive mind and autism into as accessible and understandable language as possible. Shedding new light on the predictive brain and its relation to autism, the chapters lead readers to the inevitable conclusion that many of the current interventions used in connection with autism urgently need updating and outline possibilities for revising. This approachable book synthesises advanced research for professionals across disciplines working with people with autism spectrum disorder along with readers who have or have family members with ASD.Read more…

Remembering Dionysus : Revisioning Psychology and Literature in C.G. Jung and James Hillman
 Susan Rowland

Dionysus, god of dismemberment and sponsor of the lost or abandoned feminine, originates both Jungian psychology and literature in Remembering Dionysus. Characterized by spontaneity, fluid boundaries, sexuality, embodiment, wild nature, ecstasy and chaos, Dionysus is invoked in the writing of C. G. Jung and James Hillman as the dual necessity to adopt and dismiss literature for their archetypal vision of the psyche or soul. Susan Rowland describes an emerging paradigm for the twenty-first century enacting the myth of a god torn apart to be re-membered, and remembered as reborn in a great renewal of life. Rowland demonstrates how persons, forms of knowing and even eras that dismiss Dionysus are torn apart, and explores how Jung was Dionysian in providing his most dismembered text, The Red Book. Remembering Dionysus pursues the rough god into the Sublime in the destruction of meaning in Jung and Jacques Lacan, to a re-membering of sublime feminine creativity that offers zoe , or rebirth participating in an archetype of instinctual life. This god demands to be honoured inside our knowing and being, just as he (re)joins us to wild nature. This revealing book will be invigorating reading for Jungian analysts, psychotherapists, arts therapists and counsellors, as well as academics and students of analytical psychology, depth psychology, Jungian and post-Jungian studies, literary studies and ecological humanities.Read more…

Ancient Egypt and Modern Psychotherapy : Sacred Science and the Search for Soul
 Todd Hayen

In Ancient Egypt and Modern Psychotherapy, Todd Hayen explores what the spiritual concepts of the enigmatic ancient Egyptians can teach us about our own modern psyches and the pursuit of a meaningful life. Hayen examines the ancient Egyptians possession of a concept contemporary academics have labeled "consciousness of the heart": an innate knowledge of the entirety of the universe. While all human beings possess this consciousness of the heart, our modern culture has largely lost the ability to tap into this inborn knowledge. By examining the material accomplishments of ancient Egypt, and how their seemingly deeper awareness of their inner world created a harmonious outer world, we can begin to understand how modern psychotherapy, through a Jungian perspective, could be instrumental in achieving a more profound and meaningful personal experience of life. Ancient Egypt and Modern Psychotherapy will be insightful reading for analytical psychologists in practice and in training, Jungian psychotherapists and psychologists, and academics and students of Jungian and post-Jungian studies and ancient spirituality.Read more…

Curing the Dread of Death : Theory, Research and Practice
 Menzies, R. E.;menzies, Ross G.;iverach, L.;

The dread of death has appeared throughout recorded human history in art, literature, song, myth, and ritual. In both ancient and modern societies, the spectre of death has always been with us, stalking the terrified living who seek to avoid its inevitable arrival. Our attempts to respond to the finitude of life range from ancient burial customs such as mummification to computerised chatbots which imitate the personality of those who have departed. Such efforts speak to the uniqueness of humans in their awareness of their own mortality. Yet death is not to be feared. Indeed, it may hold the key to living a vital, authentic life. The many authors of this volume argue persuasively that we cannot live fully without complete acceptance of the fragility and finiteness of life. This unique book explores the dread of death and its management from a wide range of perspectives with researchers and writers from a variety of cultures, academic traditions and disciplines across the globe. The fields covered are broad — including palliative care and grief, psychodynamic theory, social, developmental and clinical psychology, sociology and anthropology, counselling practice as well as history, art, and philosophy. Not only is this book a fascinating journey into the very core of the human psyche, it is also a guide to our psychological health. The challenge we all face is to discover pathways to an acceptance of death that enables a life of significance and meaning. Read, learn, and...Read more…

Healing Developmental Trauma : How Early Trauma Affects Self-Regulation, Self-Image, and the Capacity for Relationship
 Laurence Heller, Ph.d.; Aline Lapierre, Psy.d.

This “well-organized, valuable” guide draws from somatic-based psychotherapy and neuroscience to offer “clear guidance” for coping with childhood trauma (Peter Levine, author of Waking the Tiger and In an Unspoken Voice ). Although it may seem that people suffer from an endless number of emotional problems and challenges, Laurence Heller and Aline LaPierre maintain that most of these can be traced to five biologically based organizing principles: the need for connection, attunement, trust, autonomy, and love-sexuality. They describe how early trauma impairs the capacity for connection to self and others and how the ensuing diminished aliveness is the hidden dimension that underlies most psychological and many physiological problems. Heller and LaPierre introduce the NeuroAffective Relational Model ® (NARM), a method that integrates bottom-up and top-down approaches to regulate the nervous system and resolve distortions of identity such as low self-esteem, shame, and chronic self-judgment that are the outcome of developmental and relational trauma. While not ignoring a person’s past, NARM emphasizes working in the present moment to focus on clients’ strengths, resources, and resiliency in order to integrate the experience of connection that sustains our physiology, psychology, and capacity for relationship.Read more…

Handbook on the Clinical Treatment of Adopted Adolescents and Young Adults
 Doris Bertocci, Christopher F. Deeg, Linda Mayers

This collection bridges the voices of international scholars and adopted persons to share knowledge about clinical practice with adopted people in adolescence and early adulthood. Coming at a time when countries are beginning to focus on adoption reform, this handbook is the first to address not only the external, systemic contributions to their developmental complexities but also the underlying, internal meanings of being adopted as children become adolescents and mature into adulthood. It explains how adopted clients differ from those not adopted and emphasizes the need for clinical research on adopted people in this older age group. Exploring how clinicians can understand their client’s clinical needs, it offers specific protocols and frameworks for assessment and necessary modifications in language and treatment. With a foreword by Miriam Steele, chapters examine the legal and sociopolitical cultures, policies, and practices in which adoption is embedded, calling for broad systemic change. Embracing theoretical, conceptual, and global perspectives, this handbook is written for clinicians in all disciplines, at all tiers of practice, administration, and training, identifying the key roles they can potentially play in expanding and better focusing our understanding of the psychology of being adopted.Read more…

Positive Psychology Across the Lifespan : An Existential Perspective
 Piers Worth

"Positive Psychology Across the Life Span provides an insight into how we are affected by the different stages of adult development and gives us the opportunity to change through choice rather than leaving change to chance. The science of positive psychology offers a wealth of research and evidence-based interventions and shares insights into which habits and behaviours contribute to how to live a flourishing life. This book aims to extend that knowledge by introducing and incorporating key aspects of existential and humanistic psychology and explores positive psychology with a life-span perspective. It goes beyond theory to look at practical application, with insightful reflective questions. Whilst acknowledging the differences and disagreements between some of the key figures in the subject areas of the book it seeks to highlight the areas where there is agreement and congruence which have been previously overlooked or ignored. The book will be essential reading for students and practitioners of positive psychology, as well as other mental health professionals"-- Provided by publisherRead more…

Progress in Self Psychology, V. 16 : How Responsive Should We Be?
 Arnold I. Goldberg

Volume 16 of Progress in Self Psychology, How Responsive Should We Be , illuminates the continuing tension between Kohut's emphasis on the patient's subjective experience and the post-Kohutian intersubjectivists' concern with the therapist's own subjectivity by focusing on issues of therapeutic posture and degree of therapist activity. Teicholz provides an integrative context for examining this tension by discussing affect as the common denominator underlying the analyst's empathy, subjectivity, and authenticity. Responses to the tension encompass the stance of intersubjective contextualism, advocacy of "active responsiveness," and emphasis on the thorough-going bidirectionality of the analytic endeavor. Balancing these perspectives are a reprise on Kohut's concept of prolonged empathic immersion and a recasting of the issue of closeness and distance in the analytic relationship in terms of analysis of "the tie to the negative selfobject." Additional clinical contributions examine severe bulimia and suicidal rage as attempts at self-state regulation and address the self-reparative functions that inhere in the act of dreaming. Like previous volumes in the series, volume 16 demonstrates the applicability of self psychology to nonanalytic treatment modalities and clinical populations. Here, self psychology is brought to bear on psychotherapy with placed children, on work with adults with nonverbal learning disabilities, and on brief therapy. Rector's examination of...Read more…

The Existential Importance of the Penis : A Guide to Understanding Male Sexuality
 Daniel N. Watter;

"The first of its kind, this book applies existential principles to sexual problems, providing clinicians with the tools to understand male sexuality more deeply. Alighting from the existential psychotherapy tenets of Irvin D. Yalom, Watter introduces the notion that the penis is a conduit for male emotion, and hence regulates their ability to form and experience intimate relationships. Subsequent chapters explore an existential view of male sexual dysfunction, non-sexual trauma, hypersexuality, changing bodies through illness, age, and injury, and examines badly behaved men to understand the meaning of certain behaviors. This book will be an invaluable resource for sex therapists, marriage and family therapists, psychologists, and social workers in practice and in training, assisting them to develop the therapeutic skills that will improve their understanding of men's psychological experience"-- Provided by publisherRead more…

Applied Behavior Science in Organizations : Consilience of Historical and Emerging Trends in Organizational Behavior Management
 Ramona A. Houmanfar (Editor), Mitch Fryling (Editor), Mark P. Alavosius (Editor)

__Applied Behavior Science in Organizations__ provides a compelling overview of the history of Organizational Behavior Management (OBM) and the opportunity it presents for designing and managing positive work environments that can in turn have a positive impact on society. The book brings together leading experts from industry and research settings to provide an overview of the historical approaches in Organizational Behavior Management. It begins with an introduction to recognized practices in OBM and the applications of fundamental principles of behavior analysis to a variety of performance problems in organizational settings. The book then highlights how organizational practices and consumers’ behavior combine in a complex confluence to meet an organization’s goals and satisfy consumer appetites, whilst often unintentionally affecting the wellbeing of organizational members. It argues that the science of behavior has a responsibility to contribute to the safety, health and wellbeing of organizational members, consumers of organizational products, and beyond. Finally, the book recognizes the essential role of organizations in initiating, shaping, and sustaining the development of more nurturing and reinforcing work environments, through discussion of the need for innovation while adapting and responding to growing social upheaval, technological advances, and environmental concerns, alongside crises in the global economy, health, education, and environment.

Progress in Self Psychology, V. 18 : Postmodern Self Psychology
 Arnold I. Goldberg

Postmodern Self Psychology , the last volume of the Progress in Self Psychology series under the editorship of Arnold Goldberg, charts the path of self psychology into the postmodern era of psychoanalysis. It begins with Goldberg's thoughtful consideration of the several tributaries of self-psychological thought in the decades after Kohut and continues with Mark Gehrie's elaboration of "reflective realism" as a self-psychological way out of epistemological quagmires about the "essential reality" of the analytic endeavor. Clinical contributions offer contemporary perspectives on clinical themes that engaged Kohut in the 1970s: a study of the effect of "moments of meeting" on systems of pathological accomodation; a reappraisal of empathy as a "bi-directional negation"; and an assessment of the diverse clinical phenomena that justify a prolonged "understanding only" phase of treatment. The theory section of Volume 18 comparably charts the movement of self psychology toward a postmodern sensibility. Contributors reappraise intersubjectivity theory as a contextualist treatment approach consistent with dynamic systems theory; return to Kohut's concept of selfobject relationships, with special attention to the separate subjective and intersubjective components of selfobject experiences; and develop one of Kohut's early ideas into a theory of "forward edge" transferences that strengthen normal self-development. In all, Volume 18 is a richly insightful progress report on the...Read more…

Positive Affect Treatment for Depression and Anxiety: Therapist Guide (Treatments That Work)
 Michelle G. Craske, Halina J. Dour, Michael Treanor, Alicia E. Meuret, Halina Dour, Amanda Loerinc Guinyard

Anhedonia is a risk factor for poor prognosis and suicidality, and yet treatments to date have been relatively ineffective for anhedonia. Based on advances in behavioral and neural science, Positive Affect Treatment was developed to specifically target areas of reward sensitivity that are believed to contribute to anhedonia. These include the anticipation and motivation for reward, the response to attainment of reward, and the learning of associations between actions and reward outcomes. Positive Affect Treatment for Depression and Anxiety: Therapist Guide is intended to be used by clinicians who are familiar with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) generally and with clinical presentation of depression, anxiety and anhedonia. Results show that Positive Affect Treatment not only improves positive mood state but also decreases depression and anxiety. This guide will be an indispensable resource for all practitioners who wish to effectively and efficiently help individuals regain interest and enjoyment in their usual activities while improving their quality of life.Read more…

Transformational Chairwork : Using Psychotherapeutic Dialogues in Clinical Practice
 Scott Kellogg

Transformational Chairwork: Using Psychotherapeutic Dialogues in Clinical Practice is an exposition of the art and science of Chairwork. It is also a practical handbook for using the Chairwork method effectively with a wide range of clinical problems. Originally created by Dr. Jacob Moreno in the 1950s and then further developed by Dr. Fritz Perls in the 1960s, Chairwork has been embraced and re-envisioned by therapists from cognitive, behavioral, existential, Jungian, experiential, psychodynamic, and integrative perspectives. Transformational Chairwork builds on this rich and creative legacy and provides a model that is both integrative and trans-theoretical. The book familiarizes clinicians with essential dialogue strategies and empowers them to create therapeutic encounters and re-enactments. Chairwork interventions can be broadly organized along the lines of external and internal dialogues. The external dialogues can be used to help patients work though grief and loss, heal from interpersonal abuse and trauma, manage difficult relationships, and develop and strengthen their assertive voice. The internal dialogues in turn focus on resolving inner conflicts, combatting the negative impact of the inner critic and the experience of self-hatred, working with dreams and nightmares, and expanding the self through polarity work. Using both internal and external strategies, this book explores how Chairwork dialogues can be a powerful intervention when working with...Read more…

Jungian Perspectives on Indeterminate States : Betwixt and Between Borders
 Elizabeth Brodersen And Pilar Amezaga

In __Jungian Perspectives on Indeterminate States: Betwixt and Between Borders__, Elizabeth Brodersen and Pilar Amezaga bring together leading international contributors to analyse and interpret the psychological impact of contemporary border crossing - both literally and figuratively. Each chapter assesses key themes such as migration, culture, gender and identity formation, through a Jungian lens. All the contributors sensitively explore how creative forms can help mitigate the trauma experienced when one is forced to leave safety and enter unknown territory, and examines the specific role of indeterminacy, liminality and symbols as transformers at the border between culture, race and gender. The book asks whether we are able to hold these indeterminate states as creative liminal manifestations pointing to new forms, integrate the shadow ‘other’ as potential, and allow sufficient cross-border migration and fertilization as permissible. It makes clear that societal conflict represents a struggle for recognition and identity and elucidates the negative experiences of authoritarian structures attached to disrespect and misrecognitions. This interdisciplinary collection will offer key insight for Jungian analysts in practice and in training, psychotherapists, anthropologists, political and cultural theorists, and postgraduate researchers in psychosocial studies. It will also be of great interest to readers interested in migration, sexuality, gender, race and ethnicity studies.Read more…

Life and Work of Erich Neumann : On the Side of the Inner Voice
 ﻿angelica Löwe

__Life and Work of Erich Neumann: On the Side of the Inner Voice__ is the first book to discuss Erich Neumann’s life, work and relationship with C.G. Jung. Neumann (1905–1960) is considered Jung’s most important student, and in this deeply personal and unique volume, Angelica Löwe casts Neumann's comprehensive work in a completely new light. Based on conversations with Neumann’s children, Rali Loewenthal-Neumann and Professor Micha Neumann, Löwe explores Neumann’s childhood and adolescent years in Part I, including how he met his wife and muse Julie Blumenfeld. In Part II the book traces their life and work in Tel Aviv, where they moved in the early 1930s amid growing anti-Jewish tensions in Hitler’s Germany. Finally, in Part III, Löwe analyses Neumann’s most famous works. This is the first book-length discussion of the existential questions motivating Neumann’s work, as well as the socio-historical circumstances pertaining to the problem of Jewish identity formation against rising anti-Semitism in the early 20th century. It will be essential reading for Jungian analysts and analytical psychologists in practice and in training, as well as scholars of Jungian and post-Jungian studies and Jewish studies.Read more…

The field of applied cognitive psychology represents a new emphasis within cognitive psychology. Although interesting applied research has been published over the last several decades, and more frequently in the last dozen years, this is the first comprehensive book written about the progress in this new applied area. This text presents the theory and methodology of cognitive psychology that may be applied to problems of the real world and describes the current range of cognitive applications to real-world situations. In addition, Applied Cognitive Psychology: \*identifies the rudimentary principles of basic theory (e.g., perception, comprehension, learning, retention, remembering, reasoning, problem solving, and communication) that lend themselves to application; \*examines a range of cognitive products and services; \*begins with an explanation of the differences between basic and applied science, especially in cognitive psychology across discipline areas; \*is the first cognitive text to familiarize students with the institutional and social factors that affect communication between basic and applied researchers and, therefore, determine the success of application efforts; \*presents applications important to many problems in society and demonstrates the value of basic research in leading to these important applications; and \*cites a substantial number of references to help readers who want to apply cognitive psychology to do so.

Intimate Relationships in China in the Light of Depth Psychology : A Study of Gender and Integrity
 Huan Wang

In __Intimate Relationships in China in the Light of Depth Psychology: A Study of Gender and Integrity__, Huan Wang presents an overview of Jungian ideas as they apply to gender roles and relationships in contemporary Chinese culture. Moving beyond a Western interpretation of key concepts, Wang attempts to understand and deal with the difficulties of contemporary marriages in a rapidly changing society, investigating how young Chinese couples have been affected by traditional values, Westernisation, and the one-child policy. Wang also discusses how depth psychology has developed and been applied in China, highlighting how it differs in Chinese and Western settings and the problems and achievements Chinese people have faced. She concludes that the Chinese psyche today is experiencing a transition from the compliance of collectivism to the awareness of individuation, and that the rediscovery of the notion of integrity will help Chinese therapists to find their way, make young Chinese people independent individuals, and bring a new approach to their marriages. This is the first time such issues have been profoundly and comprehensively discussed in a Chinese context. It will be an invaluable resource for analytical psychologists, psychotherapists, and marriage and family and couple therapists working in China or with Chinese clients. It will also be of great interest to academics and students of Jungian and post-Jungian studies and to anyone interested in the psyche of...Read more…

CBT : the cognitive behavioural tsunami : managerialism, politics and the corruptions of science
 Farhad Dalal

"Is CBT all it claims to be? The Cognitive Behavioural Tsunami: Managerialism, Politics, and the Corruptions of Science provides a powerful critique of CBT's understanding of human suffering, as well as the apparent scientific basis underlying it. The book argues that CBT psychology has fetishized measurement to such a degree that it has come to believe that only the countable counts. It suggests that the so-called science of CBT is not just "bad science" but "corrupt science". The rise of CBT has been fostered by neoliberalism and the phenomenon of New Public Management. The book not only critiques the science, psychology and philosophy of CBT, but also challenges the managerialist mentality and its hyper-rational understanding of "efficiency", both of which are commonplace in organizational life today. The book suggests that these are perverse forms of thought, which have been institutionalised by NICE and IAPT and used by them to generate narratives of CBT's prowess. It claims that CBT is an exercise in symptom reduction which vastly exaggerates the degree to which symptoms are reduced, the durability of the improvement, as well as the numbers of people it helps. Arguing that CBT is neither the cure nor the scientific treatment it claims to be, the book also serves as a broader cultural critique of the times we live in; a critique which draws on philosophy and politics, on economics and psychology, on sociology and history, and ultimately, on the idea of science...Read more…

Metamorphoses of Psyche in Psychoanalysis and Ancient Greek Thought : From Mourning to Creativity
 Marcia D-S. Dobson

This unusual book explores the transformative power of liminal experiences in ancient Greek texts, psychoanalytic theory, and the author’s own life, to demonstrate how a contemporary understanding of ancient thought can illuminate modern psychoanalytic theory and practice especially as it relates to trauma, grief, and the development of psyche. With the understanding that liminal experiencing involves engaging a psychic space outside the boundaries of ego organization, Dobson artfully interweaves autobiography, literary analysis, philosophical ontology, and psychoanalysis, to formulate a new paradigm for how to construct human beings, how to enliven and deepen personal and therapeutic experience, and how poetic language is the gateway to this magical realm of transformation. Alongside richly detailed case analyses, the author uses her dual expertise in psychoanalysis and ancient Greek literature to explore how the maternal and liminal in human life were displaced with the rise of Athens and a new way of being human ― the rational citizen ― and how this repression has resulted in diminished, constricted experiencing and the suppression of women throughout western history. With a deep understanding of classical literature and psychoanalysis, and extensive clinical insights, this is essential reading for psychoanalysts, psychotherapists, classicists, and historians wishing to understand how ancient thought and modern psychoanalysis can interact.Read more…

Faith
 Michael Eigen

This book explores psychoanalytic faith and, more generally, the role of faith in the therapeutic process. In his earlier work, Eigen distinguished faith from beliefs used to organize it, the latter at once bringing people together and creating violent oppositions--belief as a defense against faith. In this new work, Eigen dives into faith experience itself and shares what he finds. Faith spans many dimensions. The opening chapters focus on variations of faith, beginning with nature, sleep, beauty, goodness, the opening-closing of the human face, and the paradox of the growth of faith through pain and shattering. Accounts of faith in the author’s life lead to creative readings of Winnicott followed by meditations on evil. A chapter is devoted to teaching and learning Bion, who called faith the psychoanalytic attitude (or called the psychoanalytic attitude Faith). Another chapter discusses variants of everyday mystical participation and a climactic moment in the Zohar, a principal part of the Kabbalah. The book ends with interviews involving the author’s development as a psychotherapist-psychoanalyst, his views on mental health and society today, followed by a note on faith-work.Read more…

Primary Love And Psychoanalytic Technique (maresfield Library)
 Michael Balint

One of the eternal problems of mankind is that of love and hate. Why and how does it happen that we love this one of our fellow-men, feel safe in his affection, expect satisfactions of our needs from him and are attracted to him, while we hate and avoid other? Ever since the publication of Freud's first works one of the main objects of psycho-analytic research has been the study of these powerful currents of the human mind. Dr. Michael Balint contributed several important papers on this subject, and Primary Love and Psychoanalytic Technique is a collection of his material from 1930 to 1952.The first half of this volume is a collection of all his papers on this topic. The first, "Psycho-Sexual Parallels to the Fundamental Law of Biogenetics", is an attempt to trace the development of the erotic instincts from their earliest biological beginnings in unicellular organisms to their highest manifestations in human beings. Other papers deal with the problems of "Genital Love". "Transference of Emotions", of "Love and Hate" and so on. Dr. Blaint shows that the complexities of human love and hate can be better understood if they are considered as derivatives of a very primitive relation such as exists between mother and child, or between two lovers, and which he describes as "primitive love".Perhaps the most important field of research where this peculiar form of human relation can be studied is the psycho-analytical situation, the relation between the patient and his...Read more…

On Being Normal and Other Disorders : A Manual for Clinical Psychodiagnostics
 Paul Verhaeghe

The central argument of On Being Normal and Other Disorders is that psychic identity is acquired through one's primary intersubjective relationships. Thus, the diagnosis of potential pathologies must also be founded on this relation. Given that the efficacy of all forms of treatment depends upon the therapeutic relation, a diagnostic of this sort has wide-ranging applications.Paul Verhaeghe's critical evaluation of the contemporary DSM-diagnostic shows that the lack of reference to and governing metapsychology impinges on the therapeutic value of the DSM categories. In response to this problem, the author sketches out the foundations of such a metapsychology by combining a Freudo-Lacanian approach with contemporary empirical research. Close attention is paid to the processes of identity acquisition to show how the self and the Other are not two separate entities. Rather, subject formation is seen as a process in which both the subject's and the Other's identity, as well as the relationship between them, comes into being. By engaging this new theoretical approach in a constant dialogue with the findings of contemporary research, this book provides a compass for the practical applications of such a differential diagnostic. Post-modern categories of anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorders are approached both through the well-known neurotic, psychotic, and perverse structures, as well as through the less familiar distinction between an...Read more…

Explorations into the Self: The Library of Analytical Psychology
 Michael Fordham; Society Of Analytical Psychology

This rewarding work is the product of sustained observation of and reflection on phenomena arising out of three broad topics in the field of analytical psychology. Firstly it analyses and evaluates the ambiguity in Jung's definitions and metaphors about the self, while at the same time expounding the theory of the self as a dynamic system, evolving through deintegration and reintegration processes during early infancy and childhood. Secondly it investigates the relation of the ego to the self, giving notable consideration to psychoanalytic work. Finally the presence of the self, behind or within both the religious and the alchemical experience, is explored. Fordham's innovative and original view of the self further extends our understanding of its dynamics and helps to establish some sense of the complementariness as well as differences between Jung and Klein.Read more…

Narcissism and Its Discontents (Studies in the Psychosocial)
 Julie Walsh

Narcissism And Its Discontents Challenges The Received Wisdom That Narcissism Is Only Destructive Of Good Social Relations.

Dialectics and Analytical Psychology: The el Capitan Canyon Seminar
 Wolfgang Giegerich, David L. Miller - Undifferentiated, Greg Mogenson

What is dialectical thinking and why do we need it in psychology? How are "moments of truth" to be psychologically discerned and differentiated? How does the recognition of the historicity of archetypal and mythological materials relate to their interpretation? In a seminar held in the El Capitan Canyon near Santa Barbara, California, in June of 2004, the renowned Jungian analyst Wolfgang Giegerich, along with conversation partners, David L. Miller and Greg Mogenson, tackled these important questions while at the same time thinking Jungian psychology forward in a radically new way. Conceived to meet "the call for more" that followed the publication of Giegerich’s landmark book, The Soul’s Logical Life, this volume also serves as the most accessible introduction to Giegerich’s approach to psychology for the first-time reader of his work. A valuable resource for students of fairy tale, myth, and depth psychology, this volume includes a complete and up-to-date bibliography of Giegerich’s writings in all languages.Read more…

Depression and the Erosion of the Self in Late Modernity : The Lesson of Icarus
 Barbara Dowds

"Depression is not a disease of the brain, a genetic disability or even a mood disorder. Rather, shutdown, numbness or sadness are non-pathological adaptations to adverse childhood and adult environments. This challenging book thus understands depression as a wise response to an unliveable situation. It can teach us what is wrong with our lives and what we must learn in order to go beyond symptom relief and reconnect to our most fundamental needs, relational, existential and spiritual. Because moods shape how we engage with our outer and inner worlds, they underlie all human behaviour. If the sociocultural world is toxic or frustrates our core needs, we will withdraw to protect ourselves. Those who have encountered a non-facilitating environment in childhood will be even more sensitive to adult stresses, since their self-organisation is fragile and non-resilient. As depression is so complex, understanding it demands an integrative approach."--Publisher's websiteRead more…

On Theology and Psychology: The Correspondence of C. G. Jung and Adolf Keller (Philemon Foundation Series)
 Carl Gustav Jung; Adolf Keller; Marianne Jehle-Wildberger; Heather Mccartney; John Peck

Jung's correspondence with one of the twentieth century's leading theologians and ecumenicists On Theology and Psychology brings together C. G. Jung's correspondence with Adolf Keller, a celebrated Protestant theologian who was one of the pioneers of the modern ecumenical movement and one of the first religious leaders to become interested in analytical psychology. Their relationship spanned half a century, and for many years Keller was the only major religious leader to align himself with Jung and his ideas. Both men shared a lifelong engagement with questions of faith, and each grappled with God in his own distinctive way. Presented here in English for the first time are letters that provide a rare look at Jung in dialogue with a theologian. Spanning some fifty years, these letters reveal an extended intellectual and spiritual discourse between two very different men as they exchange views on the nature of the divine, the compatibility of Jungian psychology and Christianity, the interpretation of the Bible and figures such as Jesus and Job, and the phenomenon of National Socialism. Although Keller was powerfully attracted to Jung's ideas, his correspondence with the famed psychiatrist demonstrates that he avoided discipleship. Both men struggled with essential questions about human existence, spirituality, and well-being, and both sought common ground where the concerns of psychologists and theologians converge. Featuring an illuminating introduction by Marianne...Read more…

Gender, Power, and Global Social Justice : The Healing Power of Psychotherapy
 Manijeh. Daneshpour

This book analyses how practitioners can use psychotherapy as a healing mechanism, focusing on the intersection of gender, power, and social justice within the global context. It begins by interrogating the concept of social justice itself before examining men's and women’s issues from biological, sociological, contextual, and ecological perspectives. Each chapter covers individual, couple, and family therapy as well as training and supervising for heterosexual and homosexual individuals from a social justice standpoint. With a centered and balanced perspective about the impact of gender and power on men's and women's relationships to each other and their ecological contexts, Daneshpour aims to help mental health practitioners privilege client voices, promote justice in gendered relationships, and manage the impact of socio-political issues in therapeutic practice.Read more…

It will be of interest to anyone concerned with the central concepts of psychoanalysis. Read more...Read more…
